# Reclama Dev

![Sad Dev](logo.png "Sad Dev")

Onde o dev chora e a mãe não vê.

## Getting Started

First, add some of the necessary env vars:

```
# API
API_URL=https://api.reclama.dev

# Sentry (optional)
SENTRY_DSN=

# Tag Manager (optional)
GTM_TAG_ID=
```


Then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:6060/api/hello](http://localhost:6060/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
